            <p>Parents want to find a school that is best for their children or 
              students want to find a school that spark their interests out of 
              a number of school, but website of each school is structured differently.

            <p>I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I’m designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research was busy parents selecting an elementary and/or secondary school out of all schools for their children. This 
              user group confirmed initial assumptions about the service’s customers, but research also revealed that excessive time spent gathering the same set of information from each school’s website was not the only users pain point. Other user problems included accessibility 
              issues (visual impairment, language barrier, etc) and an incomplete list of schools to select from.

                Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration
