          <p>People arrive at the movie 
            theatre late but still want 
            snacks without going through 
            waiting in line to order or people
             want theatre’s food to be ordered and 
             delivered elsewhere.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>The goal</h3>
          <p>Design an app for the movie theatre that 
            allows users to easily order snacks and schedule 
            a pickup or delivery without accessibility issues.

          <p>I conducted interviews and created 
            empathy maps to understand the users 
            I’m designing for and their needs. 
            A primary user group identified through
            research was busy working adults who arrive
            at the movie theatre late.
            This user group confirmed initial assumptions 
            about the movie theatre’s customers, but research 
            also revealed that waiting time to order and pick up 
            snacks was not the only factor preventing users to order 
            snacks from the theatre in person. Other user problems 
            included accessibility issues (visual impairment, 
            language barrier, etc).

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>I conducted unmoderated usability testing with 7 
            participants of various ages and 
            residences. The goal is to investigate what specific 
            difficulties users encounter when they try to 
            complete the core tasks of the movie theatre’s 
            snack-ordering app: item selection, ordering, 
            and in-app navigation. I chose the unmoderated 
            testing method since it is less prone
            to bias, and the observer effect--individuals' acting 
            differently when they are aware that 
            they are being watched--does not apply. 
            Here are a research plan 
            containing a list of prompts.

          <p>Here is a selected note-taking spreadsheet from 
            one of the 7 participants. It is evident in the observations and quotes
            that the participant can't tell the difference between "current location" 
            and "enter location". In fact, this is a common pain point among all participants. 
            This reveals that the initial design of scheduling a delivery page is not intuitive.

          <p>Impact: The app makes users feel like the movie theatre really thinks 
            about how to meet their needs.
            One quote from peer feedback: “The app made it so easy and 
            fast to order snacks and schedule a delivery! I would 
            definitely use this app instead of ordering snacks in-person. 
            I would also like to order a delivery to home when I crave movie snacks.”

            What I learned: While designing the movie theatre’s app, 
            I learned that the first ideas for the app are only the 
            beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback 
            influenced each iteration of the app’s designs.
